# Convolutional Neural Network
## Why we need CNN?
 - MLP: too many parameters(e.g. 1000*100*100*10)
 - Two important properties about image data
    - Locality: pixels that are close to each other are more likely to be related
    - Translation invariance: the same object can appear in different locations in the image

## What is Convolutional Neural Network?
 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of neural network that is specifically designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images.
 - CNNs are particularly effective for image classification tasks because they can automatically learn to detect important features in the images, such as edges, textures, and shapes.
 - CNNs use a special type of layer called a convolutional layer, which applies a set of filters to the input data to extract features.
 - CNNs also use pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions of the data and make the model more computationally efficient.

## Convolutional Layer: extract features
 - The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN.
 - It applies a set of filters (also called kernels) to the input data to extract features.
 - Each filter is a small matrix that slides over the input data and computes a dot product between the filter and the input data at each position.
 - The output of the convolutional layer is a set of feature maps, which represent the presence of different features in the input data.

## Pooling Layer: improve robustness
 - The pooling layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the data and make the model more computationally efficient.
 - It does this by downsampling the feature maps produced by the convolutional layer.
 - The most common type of pooling is max pooling, which takes the maximum value in a small region of the feature map.
 - This helps to reduce the number of parameters in the model and makes it more robust to small translations in the input data.

## Fully Connected Layer: classification
 - It takes the output of the last pooling layer and flattens it into a one-dimensional vector.
 - The output of the fully connected layer is typically passed through a softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the possible classes.
